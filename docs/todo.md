- [x] what is the role played by the default mock? not needed but a nice add-on for bigger projects
- [x] are mocks needed? no the folder isn't needed - just do them inline for now
- [x] make it work with a jsonp request
- [x] can we remove some of our grunt dependencies? I'm just using the ones the sample project was using
- [x] convert from Grunt to gulp
